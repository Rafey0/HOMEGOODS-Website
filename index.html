and written by Jane Goldman, based on Susan Hill's novel of the same name. 
It was produced by Hammer Film Productions. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe, Ciarán Hinds, 
Janet McTeer, Sophie Stuckey and Liz White. It was released in the United States and Canada 
on 3 February 2012 to generally positive reviews, and was released in the United Kingdom on

2 January 2015, without the involvement of Radcliffe.In an Edwardian-era English village, Crythin Gifford, three little girls are having a tea party with their dolls in an attic. They are smiling and having fun when they suddenly look at something in the corner. 
Then they stand up and walk trance-like to a window and jump to their deaths with blank faces. 
Some years later, in London, widowed lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is instructed to visit Crythin Gifford 
to arrange the sale of "Eel Marsh House" and examine the papers left by its deceased owner Alice Drablow. 
His legal contact Mr Jerome tries to hurry him away, but wealthy local landowner Samuel Daily (Ciarán Hinds) 
and his wife Elisabeth (Janet McTeer) allow him to stay at their home. Though most of the townsfolk treat him coldly, 
he finds companionship in the local tavern hand, Mrs Fisher, who still grieves the loss of her daughters.Daniel Radcliffe as Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer .Ciarán Hinds as Sam Daily, a local landowner.Janet McTeer as Elisabeth Daily, Daily's wife
